# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
IaC is the process of using code to provision computers, usually hosted at a data center. The machine-readable code will tell the hardware exactly what environment it needs. In best practice, the code is version controlled so you can call on the exact version you need

- benefits
    - cost
        - having the code saved means once you've got a working environment you don't need to go through the process of finding all the parts again
        - code requires fewer people and effort to maintain which saves cost
    - speed
        - automating machines is quicker than doing it manually
    - risk mitigation
        - as it is automated it removes the risk for human error
        - version control means it is less likely you'll provide the wrong machine or forget what was needed in the past

## Configuration management and orchestration under IaC

- Configuration management (e.g. Ansible)
    - configuring a server using a tool like chef, puppet or ansible
    - happens repeatedly, unlike provisioning which is usually a one-off
    - it brings consistency to the infrastructure

- orchestration (e.g. Terraform)
    - arranging or coordinating multiple systems
    - running the same task on lots of servers at once but not necessarily all of them

- comparison
    - Configuration orchestration tools, which include Terraform and AWS CloudFormation, are designed to automate the deployment of servers and other infrastructure.
    - Configuration management tools like Chef, Puppet, and the others on this list help configure the software and systems on this infrastructure that has already been provisioned.

## Ansible
- Ansible is an IT automation tool. It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate more advanced IT tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates. Ansibleâ€™s goals are foremost those of simplicity and maximum ease of use.

- benefits
    - Human readable automation (easy to use)
        - YAML
    - Powerful with a high level of configuration
    - Agentless
        - uses OpenSSH and WinRM
        - no agent to exploit or update

## Terraform
- HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share.
- You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.
- benefits
    - open source
    - simple syntax
    - modularity
    - multi-cloud


## Ansible and Terraform in DevOps
- this is a form of provisioning plus Configuration Management
- Terraform will deploy the underlying infrastructure including:
    - network topology
    - data stores
    - load balancers
    - servers
- Ansible then deploys the app to that hardware 
- benefits
    - a fully automated process using robust tools

## Ansible
- runs on your controller machine
- can do adhoc code or playbooks(scripts for ansible)
    - [adhoc cheat sheet](/Documentation/resources/IaC/Ansible-Cheat_Sheet_Edureka.pdf)
- playbooks are written in yaml, also used by:
    - docker
    - compose
    - kubernetes
    - cloud formation
- store them in /etc/ansible
