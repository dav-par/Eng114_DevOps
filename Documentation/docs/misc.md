## ERD diagrams
An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a system. ER Diagrams are most often used to design or debug relational databases in the fields of software engineering, business information systems, education and research. Also known as ERDs or ER Models, they use a defined set of symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals and connecting lines to depict the interconnectedness of entities, relationships and their attributes. They mirror grammatical structure, with entities as nouns and relationships as verbs.

##When talking about something, talk about in context of what you do

-----

# Application programming interface - API
- middleman between user and server, a framework.

## RESTful API - Representational State Transfer
- RESTful is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints for the interaction with RESTful web services
- lightweight, maintainable and scalable
- uses http (hyper text transfer protocol)
- When talking about something, talk about in context of what you do

## Data holding

## ETL
- extract, transform, load
- extract the data from somewhere
- transform the data to a workable state
- load the data to where it's needed

## Java script object notation JSON
- https://www.json.org/json-en.html
- The values must be:
    - "Name": "Value"
    - {"Name_1": "Value_1", "Name_2": "Value_2"}
    - {"Name":['value_1", "value_2"]}
- json objects are strings
- dump takes to args and transforms to json
- json load is a good example of abstraction
    strings, objects, booleans or nulls
- serialisation =  changing in to the other format
- deserialisation - changing in to our format

## Software development life cycle

### design tips
- plan everything
- automation is for saving time, if automating is taking longer then it may be better to do it manually
- you should do the db first so the app can find it
- sometimes there will be a problem with the code
    - apply the 2min rule
    - don't change the code unless it's a quick fix and the devs agree
    - it's often best to send it back to the devs and ask what they want to do


## Troubleshooting
- vm finding script with ls but saying "not found" when trying to run:
    - check `+x` chmod, note it's postive `+` and not negative `-`
    - check the first line is correct `#` + `!` + `/` into `#!/bin/bash` 

## future to do
- aws certification
- kubernetes certification
- solutions associate arch level exam

## CRUD
Create
Read
Update
Delete


## Termanology
service level agreement (sla)  
service level objectives (slo)  
service level indicators (sli)  
site reliability engineer (sre)  

## SREs
- load testings
- spike testing
- stress testing
- soak testing
- nothing goes live without testing - core to your sdlc

## pemkeys
- Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) files are a type of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) file used for keys and certificates.
- with ansible/aws if you use a pem key wrong three times it will lock
