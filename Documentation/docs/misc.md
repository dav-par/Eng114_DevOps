## ERD diagrams
An Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram is a type of flowchart that illustrates how “entities” such as people, objects or concepts relate to each other within a system. ER Diagrams are most often used to design or debug relational databases in the fields of software engineering, business information systems, education and research. Also known as ERDs or ER Models, they use a defined set of symbols such as rectangles, diamonds, ovals and connecting lines to depict the interconnectedness of entities, relationships and their attributes. They mirror grammatical structure, with entities as nouns and relationships as verbs.

##When talking about something, talk about in context of what you do


## aws

## microservices arc

## kubneties

## volume


## Data holding

## ETL
- extract, transform, load
- extract the data from somewhere
- transform the data to a workable state
- load the data to where it's needed

## HTTP Request
- HTTP request is a method of getting data from a server

## Java script object notation JSON
- https://www.json.org/json-en.html
- The values must be:
    - "Name": "Value"
    - {"Name_1": "Value_1", "Name_2": "Value_2"}
    - {"Name":['value_1", "value_2"]}
- json objects are strings
- dump takes to args and transforms to json
- json load is a good example of abstraction
    strings, objects, booleans or nulls
- serialisation =  changing in to the other format
- deserialisation - changing in to our format

## Software development life cycle

## Trouble shooting
- vm finding script with ls but saying "not found" when trying to run:
    - check `+x` chmod, note it's postive `+` and not negative `-`
    - check the first line is correct `#` + `!` + `/` into `#!/bin/bash`
