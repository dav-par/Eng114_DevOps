# MongoDB
a database solution made by the company mongoDB, comes from the word humongous

## How it works
- lets you run multiply databases on it
- MongoDB has collections (tables)
    - you have documents in a collections (they look like javascript objects)
        - they are JSONs
        - you can have nested data in objects
- it is more flexiable then SQL
- it stores data together and doesn't normalise it like SQL
    - this makes getting data quicker as they are less links and merging
