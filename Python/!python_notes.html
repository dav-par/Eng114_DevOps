Python notes:

Python is an object oriented  program, this means it is built around organising software design around data/objects together with functions rather than keeping data and functions separate. These units of combined data elements and operational elements are called a Class.

A class has three elements:
    The Properties
    The Operations
    The Name

Advantages:
    Data and functions combined
    Modularity
    Low coupling (Can take class from one program and move to another)
    Easier to re-use
    Closely models the real world

It follows the four principles of oop which are:

Abstraction
    Describing something in an abstract way, we have a shared understanding of the characteristics of an object(car, bag)
    Objects may have shared functions we can do on them (rather than hard coding the function on the object) - DON'T REPEAT CODE.

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism




Types of data:
    int
    float
    string
    complex

Strings:
    Slicing with [x:x]
    Strip to remove white space on the outside of the string xyz.strip()
        Opposite of strip is
    count = return the amount of times text appears, example_text.count("ee")
    .lower = makes lower case
    .upper = makes upper case
    .replace replaces e.g example_text.replace("text", "new text")
    f strings

Booleans:
    True != 0, False == 0, None == False (but none can be set to something), NULL != NULL
    Can be used on strings print(example_text.isalpha())
