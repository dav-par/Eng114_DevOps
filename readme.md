## Problems with traditional SDLC
The past approach to software development led to a culture of blame between developers and operations. From this the role of DevOps was formed, this was a team that understood aspects from both sides and could problem-solve to get better results for the business.

## What is DevOps  
DevOps is about bridging the gap between the developers and operations, using communication and consultancy to remove the blame culture and shifting the philosophical approach to software development from a start-stop waterfall to an infinite loop of continuous improvement.
